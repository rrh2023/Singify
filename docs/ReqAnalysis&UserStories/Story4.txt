Favoriting 
	As a user, I would like to favorite a song in order to enjoy the song repeatedly. If users search a song, after being redirected to a new page (see user “searching” story), users will find out that the favoriting feature appears at the bottom of the song and is shaped like a heart icon. It allows users to click the heart and when clicked the heart will turn red. The red heart indicates that you have added the song to favorites.
The main purpose of adding a favorites feature is that users can keep the songs which they hear very often and like the most with them and don’t have to search them again and again.
By adding a song to favorites, they will be added to a folder called favorites folder which keeps all the songs the user added to favorites, in the order of the date it was added. The user can play the songs from this playlist, play the entire playlist, unfavorite the song which will remove the song from the favorites. 
It is easy to use and a very popular/preferred feature for user’s as it keeps their favorite songs at one place and provides them easy access to it. They can even edit the list to keep up with their changing preferences and trends.
The unhappy path is that if users click on the favorite button but nothing appears in the favorites folder, then users can refresh the page to see if things change. If refreshing still can’t fix the problem, then please provide us feedback (see user “providing feedback” story).
