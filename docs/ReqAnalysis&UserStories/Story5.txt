Socializing
As a user, I would like to share songs with others in order to grow and nourish relationships. Once users log into this web application (see the user “log in” story) and get the search results (see the user “searching” story), a share button will show up on the search result page. Users can click on the share button, which will then provide them three options/buttons: go to instagram, go to facebook, go to twitter. By clicking on one of them, users will be directed to the “list of contacts” in the corresponding app and the song they want to share will be generated as a sharable link. Then, users can click on one of the contacts, and, as a result, the link will be automatically sent out to the contact along with title of the song and name of the artist. If clicking on the link, they will be directed to the search result page of our website and will be able to listen to the song.
The Unhappy path is that If after clicking on one of the three buttons that should direct users to social media apps, users may find that nothing happens. Then, users can refresh the page and click on the button again to see if things change. If refreshing still can’t fix the problem, then please provide us feedback (see user “providing feedback” story).

Update
Removed socialization functionality.

Reason for revision:
Ultimately, we don't intend for this to be a social media platform. We think perhaps adding sharing functionalities through other platforms would be viable, but have not added the functionalities as it would require more authentications.
