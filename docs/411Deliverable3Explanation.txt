We decided to proceed with React for our technology stack. Initially, we considered this along with Django as potential platforms but reasoned that we wanted a tech stack that uses one language across both the front and back end. We also realized that using one language would be easier for our team where most members have limited coding experience. Therefore, we chose to proceed with Javascript for our language, which as aforementioned is easy to learn, and use React which will be relatively easy to handle when it comes to working on the front end.
