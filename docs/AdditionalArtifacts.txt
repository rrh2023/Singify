1) Number of outside of discussion meetings: 5

2) Plans for next version: 


3) Structure of your Source Repository: 
Our repo contains primarily 3 parts: docs, prototype, and README. 
We structured it in such a way in order for someone to navigate the
repo as best as possible. The 'docs' folder contains all of our
deliverables and team assignments. Prototypes contain a decoupled 
storage of our project -- backend & frontend, folders that contain code
for each respective part of the application. Finally, our README provides
an introduction to our project.
