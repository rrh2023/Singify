1) Number of outside of discussion meetings: 
5

2) Plans for next version: 
We would ideally like the project to consist of all of the
functionalities that we had detailed in our original proposals.
These include showing related songs, playing a song etc.
There was quite a bit of a learning curve in terms of our technical skills
and it turns out our original goals were a bit too ambitious. 


3) Structure of your Source Repository: 
Our repo contains primarily 3 parts: docs, prototype, and README. 
We structured it in such a way in order for someone to navigate the
repo as best as possible. The 'docs' folder contains all of our
deliverables and team assignments. Prototypes contain a decoupled 
storage of our project -- backend & frontend, folders that contain code
for each respective part of the application. Finally, our README provides
an introduction to our project.
